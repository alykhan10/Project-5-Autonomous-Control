# Project #5: Autonomous Control
# Approximating the Closed-Loop Feedback Behaviour of a Robotic Leg

● Defined servo motor torque at the hip joint as the plant input and leg rotation angle as the output in Simulink
● Linearized equation of motion of the time-invariant system at its equilibrium point to account for under-damping
● Tuned the PID controller to specify a settling time under 0.8s and an overshoot in step response of less than 10%
